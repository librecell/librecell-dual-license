# LibreCell General Public License (LC-GPL)

## Preamble

The LibreCell General Public License (LC-GPL) is designed to maximize user freedom while fostering inclusivity, creativity, and humor in software development. 
It enables developers to use, modify, and redistribute software, including under proprietary licenses, with no binding obligations to share source code.

This license is itself dual-licensed under the LibreCell General Public License (LC-GPL) and the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later (GPLv3+). 
You may choose either license to govern your use, modification, and redistribution of this licensing text.

## Terms and Conditions

1. **Freedom to Use**  
   You are free to use this software for any purpose, without restriction.

2. **Freedom to Modify**  
   You are free to modify this software and keep those modifications private or share them under terms of your choosing.

3. **Freedom to Redistribute**  
   You may redistribute this software in its original or modified form, under any license of your choosing, including proprietary licenses.

4. **Dual-Licensed Option**  
   This software is released under a dual-license model:
   - **LibreCell General Public License (LC-GPL):** Maximizing freedom, including the right to close the source.
   - **GNU General Public License, version 3 or later (GPLv3+):** Maintaining strong copyleft principles for Libre compatibility.
   Users may choose to comply with either license at their discretion. In the case of conflicting terms, the selected license applies.

5. **No Warranty**  
   This software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, 
   fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

## Additional Request (Non-Binding)

The authors of this software hold a strong commitment to user freedom and respect for the GPLv3+. While you are free to relicense this software under non-Libre 
terms, we humbly request:

1. **Honor the Spirit:**  
   Include a note explaining your decision and how it aligns (or does not align) with the values of user freedom.

2. **For Fun:**  
   Optionally, replace this file with an image (in a Libre format, such as SVG or PNG) of a tattooed declaration on your person reading:  
   > "I am not in favor of user freedom."  
   Bonus points if it’s on your posterior.

3. **Be a Good Sport:**  
   This request is entirely non-binding. We hope it serves as a moment of reflection—and perhaps a laugh.
