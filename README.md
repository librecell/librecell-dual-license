# librecell-dual-license (LCDL/LC-GPL)

## repository overview

the **librecell-dual-license** (lcdl/lc-gpl) repository is dedicated to the implementation, exploration, and adaptation of the **librecell dual license (lcdl)**, including its core implementation and experimental branches. this initiative extends and modifies the gplv3 license while promoting user freedom and encouraging creative experimentation.

### repository structure

- **main branch**: the canonical version of the lcdl, a.k.a lc-gpl, representing the latest stable and agreed-upon implementation.

- **freedom branch**: creative adaptations emphasizing user freedom in ways that push boundaries or advance other offerings on licensing.

- **forking branch**: practical modifications of the lcdl to meet real-world needs, ensuring the license remains useful and flexible.

- **hacking branch**: experimental work to explore the limits of licensing conventions, re/appropriating norms, and breaking status quo barriers.

- **stealing branch**: playful and provocative extensions, often to emphasize the absurdity of proprietary restrictions while advancing the lcdl's principles.

### key features

1. **lcdl core principles**:
   - fully gplv3-compatible while allowing for thoughtful modifications.
   - promotes user freedom and openness in software.
   - includes the humorous yet reflective "tattoo clause" to provoke thought around licensing choices.

2. **dual license implementation**:
   - explicitly allows users to release lcdl-licensed works under alternative licenses, including non-libre ones, while preserving attribution and acknowledgment.

3. **contribution-focused**:
   - encourages community participation in refining and expanding the lcdl.

## note on the tattoo clause

the tattoo clause requests that anyone releasing lcdl-licensed work under a non-libre license display a photograph of their fulfillment of the clause as their program's startup message. this is not enforcable but might serve to offer reflection on licensing choices.
