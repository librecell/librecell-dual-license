# LibreCell Dual License (LCDL)

## Welcome to the LibreCell Dual License Repository

This repository serves as the hub for the **LibreCell Dual License (LCDL)** initiative, a framework for licensing that maximizes user freedom, 
creativity, and inclusivity while respecting the principles of open-source software.

### Branches Overview

- **`main`**: The core, formalized implementation of the LibreCell General Public License (LC-GPL), ensuring compliance with GPLv3 and the spirit of Libre software.
- **`freedom-by-librecell`**: An experimental and artistic space for creative adaptations of the license. Community members are encouraged to propose bold, meaningful variations.
- **`lcdlv1-core`**: A stable branch containing the formalized version of LCDL, designed for immediate use in projects. 
- **`lc-license-adapt`**: Focused on applying LC-GPL modifications to other license frameworks (e.g., MIT, Apache, or Creative Commons).
